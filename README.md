Tic-Tac-Toe is a game in which two players alternately put Xs and Os in compartments of a figure formed by two vertical lines crossing two horizontal lines and each tries to get a row of three Xs or three Os before the opponent does

### First Known Use of tic-tac-toe

Some ascribe the origin of Tic-Tac-Toe to the ancient Egyptians, but the most concrete ancient record we have of the game is from the Romans, and the game they referred to as terni lapilli, or three pebbles at a time.

### Etimology

Historians aren‚Äôt completely clear about the origin of the game‚Äôs name, but it could be referring to the noise of repetitive ticking or writing that goes along with the game‚Äôs play.
